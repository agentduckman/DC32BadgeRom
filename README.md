# README

Hello! This is a very basic GBStudio project that I used to add custom title screens to the DEFCON32 Badge. The Badge runs a simple Gameboy emulator and will support most ROMs.

If you just want the images I used you can just put the DC32Custom.gb into the ROM folder on the SD card, but you might need to reformat it to be FAT.
